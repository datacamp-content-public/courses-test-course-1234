## GROUP BY

Now let’s add some more complexity to our queries by using the GROUP BY clause. For evaluating the successes and potential of our “online movie renal company” (MovieNow) it is desirable to look at groups of customers or groups of products jointly. We could be interested to group customers – for example by country or gender - or we could group movies by genre or year of release. Let’s have a look at an example.

## Table: MoviesSub

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "a0a4f83884"
```

`@part1`

`@script`
Here we extracted a subset of the Movies table for illustration. We call this table MoviesSub to avoid confusion with the Movies table in our data base.

We have here the movie’s name, its genre and the price for renting the movie for 24 hours. The colors of the tuples in the table visualize the genre. Now we are interested in the average price of renting a movie for each genre. 

To do this we will use the GROUP BY statement. Let’s start very simple.

## Insert title here...

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "f3c257f96f"
```

`@part1`
```
SELECT Genre
FROM MoviesSub
GROUP BY Genre
```
{{1}}



_include figure of results_
{{2}}


`@part2`
```
SELECT Genre, AVG(Price)
FROM MoviesSub
GROUP BY Genre
```
{{3}}

_include figure of results_
{{4}}


`@script`
We select the genre form the table MoviesSub and group it by genre.

This query gives us a list of distinct genres. Now we can add aggregation function to the SELECT statement. For our example we are interested in the average price per genre, so we ad AVG of price in the SELECT statement.

The idea here is to apply the average function to subgroups of tuples in the table, where each subgroup consists of movie tuples that have the same genre. 
Note that the result table in a GROUP BY query will have as many rows as distinct values in the grouping variable.

To understand better what this query does, let’s go back to the table MoviesSub.
