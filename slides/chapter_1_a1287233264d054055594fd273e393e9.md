So,now we add some more complexity to our queries by using the GROUP BY clause, which allows us to apply aggregations to groups in the data base.

## GROUP BY Applications

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "cae64747d6"
```

`@part1`
- Preferences of customers by country or gender

- Popularity of movies by genre or year of release

- Average price of movies by genre


`@script`
We want to evaluate the success and the potential of MovieNow - of our online movie renal company. Therefore, it is often desirable to look at groups of customers or groups of products jointly. We could be interested to group customers – for example by country or gender - or we could group movies by genre or year of release. We will look now at an example where we are interested in the average price of renting a movie for each genre.

## Table: MoviesSelected

`@script`
Here we extracted a subset of the Movies table from the data base for illustration. We call this table MoviesSelected to avoid confusion with the Movies table.

We have here the movie's name, its genre and the price for renting the movie for 24 hours. Now we are interested in the average price of renting a movie for each genre. 

We will do this now step by step using the GROUP BY statement.

## Average rental price

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"

```

`@part1`
```
SELECT Genre
FROM MoviesSelected
GROUP BY Genre
```
{{0}}

`@part2`

SELECT Genre, AVG(Price)

`@script`
This is the basic SQL query with GROUP BY. We select the genre form the table MoviesSelected and group it by genre.

This query gives us a list of distinct genres. By itself this is nothing else than use the SELECT DISTINCT statement, but with the GROUP BY clause we can add now aggregation functions to the SELECT statement. For our example we are interested in the average price per genre, so we ad the average of price in the SELECT statement as you can see here and obtain a table with the genres and the average price per genre.

The idea is to apply the average function to subgroups of tuples in the table, where each subgroup consists of movie tuples that have the same genre. 

To understand better what this query does, let’s go back to the table MoviesSelected.

## MoviesSelected table

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "129cbd5ba1"
```

`@script`
We can think of a GROUP BY statement as a split into subgroups. The colors of the tuples in the table visualize the genres. The GROUP BY Genre clause makes groups based upon the genre ...

## MoviesSelected table split

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "deb68bf8a8"
```

`@part1`

`@script`
...as you can see here - every group in a separate table. We have a group for the genre Fantasy, Drama and so on. Then we can apply any aggregation functions to each of the sub-tables. In the previous query we calculated the average price for each group. Now, we can additionally use COUNT to get the number of movies in each sub-table, for example 3 for Fantasy and 4 for Drama.

## Average rental price and number of movies

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "1e1c04f049"
```

`@part1`
```
SELECT Genre, AVG(Price), COUNT(*)
FROM MoviesSelected
GROUP BY Genre
```

`@script`
This is the query extended by the number of movies in each category.

We have used COUNT with a star before to count all tuples in a query. Now we use it to count the tuples in each subgroup separately, that means we count the number of movies for each genre.

## Let's practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "561d9273fe"
```

`@script`
Ok, now it’s your turn to use GROUP BY queries.
